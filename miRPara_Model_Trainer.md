# Introduction #

miRPara\_model\_trainer.pl was designed to train the miRPara models based on newly released miRBase data. It supports miRBase 13.0 or higher.
Basically, it will:
  * extract the experimentally verified pri-miRNAs
  * calculate the parameters for each pri-miRNA
  * group the parameters into overall, sub-groups and species name
  * create 20 levels negative parameters for each group
  * train the models

The selection of miRPara\_model\_trainer.pl have to match the miRPara.pl version:
|Model Trainer Version|miRPara Version|
|:--------------------|:--------------|
|3.0 or above         |6.0 or above   |
|2.3 or below         |5.3 or below   |

# Requirement #
**Version 3.0 or above**
  * File::chdir
  * Cwd
  * threads
  * threads::shared
  * miRPara.pl (any version)
  * libsvm (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)

**Version 2.3 or below**
  * perl
  * File::chdir
  * Algorithm::SVM
  * Algorithm::SVM::DataSet
  * Cwd
  * miRPara.pl

# Usage #
**Version 3.0 or above**

The script is written in perl and no need to install.

**_Usage:_**
```
Usage: 
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl <miRBase Version> <Full miRPara address> <steps> <cores> <species>

Example: 
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 1,2,3,4 12 all

Steps(more than one steps can be given at one time, separated by ","):
1	extract experimentally varified miRNA sequences
2	calculate the miRPara parameters
3	generate the parameters for training
4	model training

Species (one of following):
<all> - all species
<species short name> - eg. hsa
```
**_Example:_**

1. Only extract the experimentally verified miRNA from miRBase version 19, the number of cores and the species does not matter in this step, any number and any species can be given:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 1 1 all
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 1 2 hsa
```

2. Only calculate the miRPara parameters, the species does not matter in this step, any species can be given:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 2 1 all
```

3. Only generate the parameters for training, here 12 cores and hsa parameters was generated:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 3 12 hsa
```

4. Only train the models for cel with 12 cores:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 4 12 cel
```

5. Completely train the models for the miRBase 18 with 12 cores:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 18 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 1,2,3,4 12 all
```

6. Only generate parameters and train the models for the human from miRBase 19 with 12 cores:
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer_v3.0.pl 19 /usr/bin/miRPara.pl 3,4 12 hsa
```


**Version 2.3 or below**

The script is written in perl and no need to install.

**_Usage:_**
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer.pl <miRBase Version> <Full miRPara address>
```

**_Example:_**
```
perl miRPara_model_trainer.pl 19 /home/xxx/xxx/miRPara.pl
```

# Notes #
**Version 3.0 or above**
The training is a slow process, it take around 72 hours in:
Ubuntu 12.04
CPU 2.40GB X 12
Memory: 24 GB

**Version 2.3 or below**

The training is a slow process, it might take as long as one week to finish all trains.
